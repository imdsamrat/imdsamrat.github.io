# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
I am from India and I am currently a software engineer at Standard Chartered GBS - India. Prior to that I have worked as software engineer at Samsung Research Institute, Bangalore and as software developer at Ola cabs, Bangalore. I persued my Bechelor in Computer Science and Engineering from National Institute of Technology, Allahabad. 

I started learning programming at my college. Slowly, I learnt about the endless possibilities of computer programs along with the enjoyment of challenging myself to make my programs work. In addition to being passionate about programming, I am eager to challenge myself to do things I've never accomplished before and I strive to learn and improve on my skills every day.
